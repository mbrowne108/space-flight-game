# Star Trek: The Game

Star Trek: The Game is a pet project developed entirely using vanilla JavaScript on the HTML Canvas, no external libraries or frameworks, and minimal CSS. The game places you at the helm of the USS Enterprise as you fly around a fully orbiting solar system rescuing people from each planet while fending off attacks from an ever growing Klingon fleet.

The purpose of this game was to really dive deep into the logic of JavaScript, without taking any shortcuts via libraries or engines. I also wanted to flex my former career's music composition muscle in the process.

##How to Play

Go to [mbrowne108.github.io/star-trek-the-game/](https://mbrowne108.github.io/star-trek-the-game/) to play.

## Features

* Fully mobile solar system, each planet with their own orbit around the sun, some with their own moons orbiting them, each at different speeds.

* Asteroid Belt featuring hundreds of asteroids each moving at their own speed and direction, in addition to spinning on their own axis.

* Klingon enemies with basic attacking and retreating AI.

* Ability to use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out around the ship.

* Scanning and tracking for both enemy ships and planets around the solar system.

* 8-bit chip tune music for the main menu and each planet. Some were composed/arranged by myself, and a few were incorporated from outside sources (see credits below).
